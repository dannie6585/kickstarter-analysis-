# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
the purpose of the project was to determine how long it took plays funded by crowd funding to acheive the campaign goal. We analyzed data from about 1000 plays to determine if thier campaign was a success, if they acheived their goal, and the amount of time it took. 

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
my analysis used graphs to show the outcome of each campaign. the graph provided the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. because there was a lot of data the graph made it easier to visulize the campaign outcomes. i ran into a problem when my code did not copy correctly. i had to go back to see why the first data point was 0. once i reviewed each formula the graph corrected itself. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
based on the data I was able to determine that most campaigns under 5000 was succesful. campaigns under 25000 were moderately sucessessul. however, campaign between 35000 and 45000 also showed great success. the data did not provide clarity on the why. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
in the date we anayalized campaign funds raised for plays. In the data we were able to determine the percentages of successful, failed and canceled campaign. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
the challenge that I faced was getting the countifs formula correct. Understanding how to set the formula up was most difficult. mostly understanding how to group the criteria to write the formula correclty. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
    Campaigns in ranging btween 1000 and 4999 were most successful. Most campaign under 25000 were at least fifty percent succesful. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude based off the goal that all of the campaigns were compeleted regardless of how successful they were. it also shows that most of the campaigns were successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
the limitation that i believed was placed on the data is that it did not show how much the campaign were off by or what factor caused them to fail. I think by understadning this two data points we could better understand if the campaign failed only because it did not reach the goal based on the goal field. if a million dollar campaign missed goal by 1 does it make it a fail.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? we could create graphs that compares the precentages of successful campaign. understand why a campaign that range between 35000 and 40000 is more successful than a campaign that range between 25000 and 30000.
